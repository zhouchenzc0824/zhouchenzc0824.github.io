>REST and SOAP, they are like twins and people debated a lot about the advantage and disadvantage for them for a long period of time.

First, let's clarify something that it was confusing new comers to the web services or even some highly qualified engineers. **SOAP** is a protocol type while **REST** is an architectural style which means that they are not even comparable. However, they, all of a sudden, became comparable to some degree because they are both being able to serve as a method to transmit data in some certain format using the most commonly adopted protocol which is HTTP that the verbs are being used.

To be strick, REST should be compared against SOA or RPC.

`SOA`, AKA Service Oriented Architecture, is a architectural style that is focused around Messages.
`RPC`, AKA Remote Procedure Call, is an another style that is focused on Operations.
`REST`, AKA Representational state transfer, is focused on Resources.

`单行代码引用就一对引号`

```Java
public static void main(String[] args)
{
    System.out.println("多行代码就可以用三对引号来显示,还可以选择是什么语法就把语言名字加在第一行三引号后面");
}
```
